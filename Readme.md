# This Project is a demonstration of what I am learning with Rust and TypeScript.

## What I am learning with Rust:

- Mutable Means = Changeable Variable (:
- Immutable = Vice Verse
- By default Variables are immutable. Once Initiated, It cannot be changed
- It is a statically typed language so all variables must have a data type at compile time
- Rust Compiler can automatically assign a data type at compile time i.e. let x = 10;
- There are multiple ways to assign int and float types i.e. i32, u32
- u32 = Unsigned Int, i32 = Integer 32bit
- Example 1: let mut x: i32 = 1500;
- Example 2: let mut y = 15_u32;
- Error: x+y ==> because x is a 32bit integer and y is an unsigned 32-bit integer with more range
- The above Error will cause an overflow issue

# What's New

1. Added a lib folder and a guessing game.
2. Soon adding thirsty crow game (:...
