# This Project is demonistration of what am learning with Rust and TypeScript for TypeSafety.

## What am learning with Rust:

- Mutable Means = Changable Variable (:
- Immutable = Vice Verse
- By default Variables are immutable. Once Initilized, It cannot be changed
- It is statically typed language so all variables must have a data type at complie time
- Rust Compiler is can automatically assign a data type at complie time i.e. let x = 10;
- There are multiple ways to assign int and float type i.e. i32, u32
- u32 = Unsigned Int, i32 = Interger 32bit
- Example 1: let mut x: i32 = 1500;
- Example 2: let mut y = 15_u32;
- Error: x+y ==> because x is 32bit integer and y is unsigned 32 bit integer with more range
- Above Error will cause overflow issue
